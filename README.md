# Luxor Component for Home Assistant

[![hacs][hacsbadge]][hacs]

_Component to integrate with [FXLuminaire's Luxor][luxor] lighting system._

This will make all Luxor groups available as `light` entities, exposing the brightness functionality. Unfortunately colors cannot be exposed due to the way Luxor defines and utilizes them.

Additionally it will expose all themes as `scene` entities.
